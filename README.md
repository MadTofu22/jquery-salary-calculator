# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

This project creates a simple calculator to input an employee's first name, last name, employee ID number, their title, and annual salary and display them in a table.

At the bottom of the page will be the current monthly total spent on company wide salaries. If that total reaches over $20,000 it will be highlighted red. I'm a student, not a mogul that can provide high paying jobs.

This project was created as a weekend challenge while attending [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) in week 1 of Tier 2.
